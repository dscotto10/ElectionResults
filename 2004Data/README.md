Some 2004 data. There's a combination of a couple of sources here: Wikipedia, mostly, with some from the Michigan Secretary of State's website, as well as from data.gov:

At a later date, I might just go with the data.gov data, which is in an odd format, but I think I can probably figure it out, and it's more reliable than Wikipedia.
